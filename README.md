# tictacfk
genetic algorithms to try to learn tic tac toe in brainf***

Can a genetic algorithm generate an AI to play tic tac toe?
Probably???

It's close to generating an optimal strategy.
It generated the program <<+++<<+<+<<<<[>+[>[+>++++>]-]]<. which is remarkably close to only
generating a "perfect" output. 

At some point, I want to convert to rust. Python is slow and hard to profile properly.
